# Transformer with explanation working with tabular data
This project presents an Explainable Transformer for working with tabular data in binary or multiclass classification tasks with different datasets containing categorical and/or numerical features. 

The explanation is provided locally as the importance of the variables to explain how the model has arrived at the results obtained with the input example.
